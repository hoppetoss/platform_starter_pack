# Platform Starter Pack

### The Big Picture, on what does a Platform Engineer do (explained simply)

Imagine you’re in a busy restaurant kitchen.
The developers are the chefs, they make the dishes (apps).
The Platform Engineers are the kitchen designers and maintainers, they build the stove, manage the ovens, automate the order system, make sure ingredients (dependencies) arrive on time, and ensure safety and hygiene rules (security, compliance) are followed.

If the stove breaks, the chefs can’t cook.
If the menu changes, the kitchen must adapt quickly.

**That’s Platform Engineering**: building and running the foundation that lets developers deliver fast, safely, and repeatedly.

### The "Why" Behind a Platform Team

You want to be able to scale, more services, more developers, more releases.

Without a stable platform, teams waste time reinventing environments, fixing CI/CD pipelines, or debugging Kubernetes misconfigurations.

So the Platform Team is being formed to:
	•	Standardize how apps are built, deployed, and monitored.
	•	Provide self-service tools for developers (an Internal Developer Platform, or IDP).
	•	Balance speed (developer autonomy) with control (security, compliance, cost).

The mission: make developers’ lives easier while keeping the system reliable, secure, and cost-efficient.

### The Key Responsibilities of a Platform Engineer

Maintaining and Managing Kubernetes Clusters
- Most modern apps these days run as containers.
- Kubernetes handles scaling, updates, and healing.
- The PE job is to keep the platform healthy and predictable.

Common Tasks:

	1.	Maintain cluster versions and upgrades.
	2.	Manage namespaces, network policies, ingress controllers, storage classes.
	3.	Implement autoscaling (HPA/VPA/Cluster Autoscaler).
	4.	Monitor node health, control plane metrics, and workloads.
	5.	Use IaC (Terraform) to keep everything reproducible.
