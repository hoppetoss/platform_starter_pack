# Platform Starter Pack

### The Big Picture, on what does a Platform Engineer do (explained simply)

Imagine you’re in a busy restaurant kitchen.
The developers are the chefs, they make the dishes (apps).

The Platform Engineers are the kitchen designers and maintainers, they build the stove, manage the ovens, automate the order system, make sure ingredients (dependencies) arrive on time, and ensure safety and hygiene rules (security, compliance) are followed.

If the stove breaks, the chefs can’t cook.
If the menu changes, the kitchen must adapt quickly.

**That’s Platform Engineering**: building and running the foundation that lets developers deliver fast, safely, and repeatedly.

### The "Why" Behind a Platform Team

You want to be able to scale, more services, more developers, more releases.

Without a stable platform, teams waste time reinventing environments, fixing CI/CD pipelines, or debugging Kubernetes misconfigurations.

So the Platform Team is being formed to:

	•	Standardize how apps are built, deployed, and monitored.
	•	Provide self-service tools for developers (an Internal Developer Platform, or IDP).
	•	Balance speed (developer autonomy) with control (security, compliance, cost).

The mission: make developers’ lives easier while keeping the system reliable, secure, and cost-efficient.

### The Key Responsibilities of a Platform Engineer

#### Maintaining and Managing Kubernetes Clusters

	• Most modern apps these days run as containers.
	• Kubernetes handles scaling, updates, and healing.
	• The PE job is to keep the platform healthy and predictable.


Common Tasks:

	1.	Maintain cluster versions and upgrades.
	2.	Manage namespaces, network policies, ingress controllers, storage classes.
	3.	Implement autoscaling (HPA/VPA/Cluster Autoscaler).
	4.	Monitor node health, control plane metrics, and workloads.
	5.	Use IaC (Terraform) to keep everything reproducible.

#### Automating Deployment and Scaling Processes

The goal is to automate how applications go from code → container → Kubernetes → running service.

The reason we want this is because manual deployments lead to human error and slow delivery, while Automation leads to consistency + speed.

How do we do this?

	• Use GitHub Actions to build containers, run tests, and deploy to clusters.
	• Manage deployments via FluxCD or ArgoCD (GitOps model).
	• Define everything as code, Helm charts, manifests, Terraform modules.

Example:

A developer merges a PR → GitHub Actions builds and pushes an image → GitOps (FluxCD or ArgoCD) detects the new version → automatically syncs Kubernetes manifests.

---

#### Implementing Security and Compliance Measures

The goal is to secure containers, clusters, and pipelines.

We want to sure to protect the organization from vulnerabilities, data leaks, and misconfigurations.

How do we do this?

	• Enable role-based access control (RBAC) in Kubernetes.
	• Use image scanning (Trivy, Aqua, or GitHub Advanced Security).
	• Enforce policies via OPA/Gatekeeper.
	• Keep secrets safe (Azure Key Vault, sealed-secrets).
	• Regularly patch nodes and dependencies.


#### Supporting Developers in Building Containerized Apps

What:

Developers need guidance and tools to containerize and deploy apps correctly.

Why:

Consistency reduces “it works on my machine” issues.

How:
	•	Create and maintain base Docker images.
	•	Provide example manifests or Helm templates.
	•	Offer internal documentation and workshops.
	•	Build the Internal Developer Platform (IDP), a self-service portal to deploy apps without knowing Kubernetes internals.

We will tackle IDP later on, but for now think of the IDP as a “vending machine for environments. 

Developers choose what they need (app type, database, environment), and your platform delivers it automatically.

#### Troubleshooting Issues and Resolving Incidents

What:
When something breaks (failed deployments, crashed pods, network issues), you debug and fix it.

Why:
Your goal: mean time to recovery (MTTR) should be minimal.

How:
	•	Use kubectl logs, kubectl describe, and Lens or k9s.
	•	Use centralized logging.
	•	Correlate events via traces or alerts from monitoring tools (Prometheus/Grafana).
	•	Collaborate with dev teams during incidents.

#### Keeping an Eye on Cost-Effectiveness

What:
Every pod, node, and storage volume costs money.

Why:
Kubernetes can scale infinitely, and so can your cloud bill.

How:
	•	Use resource limits and requests.
	•	Monitor cost per namespace.
	•	Autoscale intelligently.
	•	Prefer spot instances or reserved nodes for predictable workloads.
